Q-1-A permutation perm of n + 1 integers of all the integers in the range [0, n] can be represented as a string s of length n where:
- s[i] == 'I' if perm[i] < perm[i + 1], and
- s[i] == 'D' if perm[i] > perm[i + 1].
Given a string s, reconstruct the permutation perm and return it. If there are multiple valid permutations perm, return **any of them*

Q-2-You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:
- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true *if* target *is in* matrix *or* false *otherwise*.
You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

Q-3-Given an array of integers arr, return *true if and only if it is a valid mountain array*.
Recall that arr is a mountain array if and only if:
- arr.length >= 3
- There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
    - arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
    - arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]

Q-4-Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

Q-5-The **product sum** of two equal-length arrays a and b is equal to the sum of a[i] * b[i] for all 0 <= i < a.length
(**0-indexed**).
- For example, if a = [1,2,3,4] and b = [5,2,3,1], the **product sum** would be 1*5 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*1 = 22.
Given two arrays nums1 and nums2 of length n, return *the **minimum product sum** if you are allowed to **rearrange** the **order** of
the elements in* nums1.

Q-6-An integer array original is transformed into a **doubled** array changed by appending **twice the value** of every element in 
original, and then randomly **shuffling** the resulting array.
Given an array changed, return original *if* changed *is a **doubled** array. If* changed *is not a **doubled** array, return an empty
array. The elements in* original *may be returned in **any** order*.

Q-7-Given a positive integer n, generate an n x n matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.

Q-8-Given two sparse matrices mat1 of size m x k and mat2 of size k x n, return the result of mat1 x mat2. You may assume that 
multiplication is always possible.
